# What is SMM #

SMM stands for **Sean's Movie Manager**

SMM is an application to manage your movies.

- manage your downdloaded or ripped movie file
- grap movie information from tmdb.org
- display beautiful movie poster
- search movie and play movie

# Why I create SMM #

I start from find a usable movie manager for myself. I did a lot research, but most of them just not suitable for me. [Med's Movie Manager](http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmm/) is the most close one, and it is open sourced.

I start by adding function to Med's Movie Manager, but suddenly it graps me and I get a madness to decide create a totally different one.

# Sorry if anything is wrong #

I am a newbie with open source, so maybe did something wrong, for example, I include other open source project in my code, only because it is more convenient to debug.

Please let me know if anything is wrong.

# How it look like #

Here is the screenshot(todo)

# Why SMM is speical #

- It support python plugin.
- It focus the downloaded/ripped movie management
- (todo)

# Why not Plex

Plex的理念似乎和SMM很像。而且它的界面也非常漂亮。更重要的是它还集成了播放器。

乍一看，觉得完全没有必要重写一个SMM。

但仔细想了一想，觉得SMM有其他的优势：

	* 功能上并不完全和Plex重合，比如我想要的随机选取功能，Plex做不到。
	* Python的插件系统，要比Plex的插件系统容易加新功能
	* 它不带播放器，依赖系统的播放器。固然不够强大，但也可以说很灵活。
	* Java和Python，我最熟悉的语言，添加功能更容易。
	* 开源。

对于SMM，我还有另外一层的感情。就和自己的孩子一样，可以不时地加点新功能什么的。
