SMM stands for **Sean's Movie Manager**

SMM is an application to manage your movies.

# Why I create SMM #

I start from find a usable movie manager for myself. I did a lot research, but most of them just not suitable for me. [Med's Movie Manager](http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmm/) is the most close one, and it is open sourced.

I start by adding function to Med's Movie Manager, but suddenly it graps me and I get a madness to decide create a totally different one.
